# Eloquent JavaScript Exercises and Examples

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises in the book "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke. Additionally, I've also written down some of the examples that I (a long-time Java developer) found particularly interesting. It serves as a space for my exploration of JavaScript concepts.

## Structure

The repository is organized by chapters, with each chapter residing in its own folder. 

I've also adopted a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to reinforce my understanding of the code. Each example and exercise has an associated test file, written using Jest. These tests verify the functionality and expected behavior of the implemented code, allowing me to practice not only JavaScript but also TDD principles.

## Running the code and its associated tests

* Run a specific example or exercise:
  ```
  node chapter-2/exercise-1.js
  ```
* Run a specific example or exercise test:
  ```
  npm test -- chapter-2/exercise-1.test.js
  ```
* Run all tests:
  ```
  npm test
  ```

## Contributing

Feel free to suggest improvements or optimizations for any of the solutions! Contributions that offer alternative approaches or more efficient solutions are greatly appreciated.
